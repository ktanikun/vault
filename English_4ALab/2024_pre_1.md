4 (A) 以下の英文の段落(21)~(25)にはそれぞれ誤りがある。修正が必要な下線部を各段落から一つずつ選び、マークシートの(21)~(25)にその記号をマークせよ。

(21) Wildfires can be sparked by lightning, though more often they have a human cause, such as downed power lines, (a) carelessly discarded cigarettes, (a) campfires or arson. The first sign is usually smoke, spotted by a member of the public or via cameras set up in high-risk, remote areas. The tactics (b) used to fighting wildfires (b) are much the same the world over, and (c) have changed little in recent decades. (c) Response teams in land vehicles, planes or helicopters are mobilised to use water and fire-retardant chemicals (d) to try to dampen the flames. (d) Crews of firefighters also create "fire lines" (e) that the conflagration cannot cross, (e) by removing vegetation and digging down to the dirt. It can be expensive, resource-intensive work.

(22) Once they reach a certain size, however, fires simply release (a) too much energy to be fought, (a) explains Alexander Held, a fire ecologist at the European Forest Institute. Water evaporates before (b) it reaches the flames (b) and it becomes impossible to get (c) nearly enough to contain the blaze. (c) In these cases, there is often (d) little to do but wait (d) for changes in weather, wind or topography (e) that might make the fire controllable (e) once more.

(23) Fire crews are busier than ever, yet their toolkit (a) no longer seems sufficient. (a) Although the proportion of fires (b) that become large and difficult to contain (b) each year is not increasing, (c) those that do get big (c) are doing more damage. Six of the 20 largest blazes ever seen in California ignited in 2020, (d) that was the worst year (d) for wildfires in the state's history, according to the National interagency Fire Centre. And the damage they cause is getting worse as more people live in the areas next to forests. Climate change is adding to the woe, as temperatures rise and droughts become more severe (e) in places already prone to burning. (e)

(24) The policy of fire suppression, introduced in the 20th century, (a) is increasingly being questioned. (a) Trying to put out every fire (b) results in greater stores of unburned fuel (b) — including dried grass, shrub, trees, leaves and forest matter — to feed subsequent fires. In earlier times indigenous and agricultural societies started fires deliberately, or (c) allowed smaller wildfires to burn. (c) This got rid of fuel and reduced the risk of a larger, uncontrollable fire later on. Such practices were mostly abandoned after technology (d) created the illusion that all conflagrations (e) could, and should, extinguish. (e)

(25) But experts are now advocating (a) a shift from suppressing to managing (a) fires through better land management. This includes making sure that landscapes include (b) breaks that fires cannot cross. (b) In 2017, four large wildfires killed 65 people in Portugal, (c) the deadliest in its history. (c) The country subsequently decided to prioritise land management, including the creation of buffer zones and the setting of deliberate fires during the winter, (d) when they can be controlled. (d) Portugal (e) had not suffered a disastrous blaze (e) since.
