(21) We like talking and gossiping because language is a form of grooming. For monkeys and apes, grooming is (a)less a matter of hygiene and more (a) an expression of commitment. Its sense (b)is more that of:(b) "I'd rather be here grooming with you (c)than over there with her."(c) It's an essential feature of all intimate relationships. Language is a kind of grooming at a distance and, in many ways, serves (d) much the same kind (d) of purpose. It allows us to make that all-important statement about commitment: "I find you interesting (e) enough to waste time talking." (e)

(22) Of course, language allows us to go one step beyond mere signals of commitment. It allows us to exchange information. (a) Monkeys and apes are restricted (a) to direct observation when it comes to learning (b) about who might make a good friend (b) and who is unreliable, or who is going out with whom. But we can learn (c) about these things at second thought, (c) and that greatly extends our circle of social knowledge. (d) Take a listen to (d) the conversation next to you. It will soon become clear that most of our conversations (e) are concerned with social doings.(e) Sometimes our own, sometimes other people's.

(23) There is, however, (a) a curious asymmetry (a) in the conversations of men and women. Harry, it seems, (b)likes to talk about Dick,(b) but (c)Sally talks about Susan.(c) "Ah," you say, (d)"everyone's stereotypes are confirmed."(d) Well, yes and no. There's no smoke without fire, of course. But the really interesting question is (e) why it should be like this. (e)

(24) (a) Men's and women's preferred conversation topics (a) are often radically different because they are playing rather different games. Listen carefully to what they say, and you soon realize that women's (b) conversations are primarily geared to (b) servicing their social networks, building and maintaining a complex web of relationships in a social world (c)that is forever changing.(c) Keeping up to date on everyone's doings is (d) as important as the implicit suggestion that you are a member of the in-group. (d) It's the very hub of the social merry-go-round, (e) the foundation of which society itself is built. (e)

(25) In contrast, men's conversations seem to be geared (a) as much to advertising as anything else.(a) They talk about themselves or they talk about (b)things they claim to know a lot about. (b) It's a kind of vocal form of the peacock's tail. Peacocks hang about on their mating territories and display their brilliant tails (c) whenever a female goes out of view. (c) Humans, it seems, do all this vocally. Like the peacocks that suddenly raise their tails when a peahen is near, men switch into advertising mode when women are present. Have a listen to the same man when (d) he is talking only to other men(d) and compare it with what he talks about when women are present. When there are women present, his conversational style changes dramatically. (e)It becomes more showy,(e) more designed to stimulate laughter as a response.
