(21) Since the Renaissance, (a) <u>almost all painting</u> had obeyed a convention: that of one-point perspective. It was a geometrical system for depicting the illusion of reality, based on the fact that things seem to (b) <u>get smaller as they go further up</u> one's eye. Once (c) <u>the construction for a perspective scene is done,</u> things can be represented on a flat sheet of paper (d) <u>as though they were in three-dimensional space.</u> To fifteenth-century artists, perspective was the most precious tool of the trade. (e) <u>No more powerful tool for creating visual illusion</u> had ever been invented.

(22) Nevertheless, there are problems with perspective. It (a) <u>presupposes that a certain way of seeing things, and this way does not always</u> (b) <u>accord with the way we actually see.</u> Essentially, perspective is (c) <u>a form of abstraction.</u> It simplifies the relationship between eye, brain, and object. It is an ideal view, (d) <u>imagined as being seen by a one-eyed, motionless person who is</u> (e) <u>separated from what he sees.</u>

(23) (a) <u>Despite its apparent precision,</u> perspective is a generalization about experience. It does not really represent (b) <u>the way that we see.</u> Look at an object: your eye is never still. (c) <u>So is your head still</u> in relation to the object. The more you move, the bigger the differences become. Any sight is (d) <u>a sum of different glimpses.</u> Both the viewer and (e) <u>the view are part of the same field.</u> Reality, in short, is interaction.

(24) The idea that the looker affects the sight is taken for granted in most scientific fields today. Of course, it does not mean that there is no true reality. (a) <u>It does not mean</u> that if I see a mouse under the chair I can erase the creature's existence because (b) <u>it's just a product of my imagination.</u> In the real world, mice do exist and they generally (c) <u>go about their business whether I see them or not.</u> (d) <u>It does not mean, however, that my presence in the room may influence the mouse.</u> It will almost certainly not behave the same way when I am in the room as when I am not. The eye and its objects inhabit the same field, and they influence one another mutually. This idea forms the basis of particle physics and psychology. In the late nineteenth century, it was (e) <u>not generally thought to be true.</u>

(25) However, towards 1900, as the idea developed (a) <u>in its scientific form</u> through the work of scientists such as Albert Einstein, one artist, scientifically illiterate, living in seclusion in the South of France, was labouring to explore the relativeness of seeing. His name was Paul Cézanne, and he was the father of abstract art. What is there, especially in the work from 1890 onwards, is (b) <u>a vast curiosity about the relativeness of seeing,</u> coupled with (c) <u>an equally vast doubt that he or anyone else could express in paint.</u> The Renaissance (d) <u>admired an artist's certainty</u> about what he saw. But with Cézanne, "This is what I see" (e) <u>became replaced by a question:</u> "Is this what I see?"
