(21) In 2023, Google awarded a total of US$10 million to researchers who found vulnerabilities in its products. Why? Because (a) allowing errors to go undetected (a) could be much costlier.  Data breaches could lead to refund claims, reduced customer trust or legal liability. (b) It's not just private technology companies that invest (b) in such bug bounty programmes. Between 2016 and 2021, the US Department of Defense awarded more than US$650,000 to people (c) who found weaknesses in its networks. (c) Just as many industries devote hefty funding to incentivizing people to find and report bugs and glitches, (d) as the science community should reward (d) the detection and correction of errors in the scientific literature.  In our industry, too, (e) the costs of undetected errors are staggering. (e)

(22) That's because I have joined with meta-scientist Ian Hussey at the University of Bern and psychologist Ruben Arslan at Leipzig University in Germany to pilot a bug-bounty programme for science, funded by the University of Bern. Our project, Estimating the Reliability and Robustness of Research (ERROR), (a) pays specialists to check highly cited published papers, (a) starting with the social and behavioural sciences. Our reviewers are paid a base rate of up to 1,000 Swiss francs (around US$1,100) (b) for each paper they check, (b) and a bonus for any errors they find. The bigger the error, (c) the greater the reward (c) — up to a maximum of 2,500 francs. Authors who let us scrutinize their papers are compensated, too: 250 francs (d) to cover the work needed to prepare files or answer reviewer queries, (d) and a bonus 250 francs if no errors (or only minor ones) are found in their work.

(23) ERROR launched in February and (a) will run for at least four years. (a) So far, (b) we have sent out (b) almost 60 invitations, and 13 sets of authors have (c) agreed to have their papers assessed. (c) One review has been completed, (d) revealing minor errors. (d) I hope that the project will demonstrate the value of systematic processes to detect errors in published research. I am convinced that such systems are needed, (e) because current checks are sufficient. (e)

(24) (a) Unpaid peer reviewers are overburdened, (a) and have little incentive to painstakingly examine survey responses, comb through lists of DNA sequences or cell lines, (b) or go through computer code line by line. (b) Mistakes frequently slip through. And researchers have little to gain personally from sifting through (c) published papers looked for errors. (c) (d) There is no financial compensation for highlighting errors, (d) and doing so (e) can see people marked out as troublemakers. (e)

(25) Yet failing to keep abreast of this issue (a) comes at a huge cost. (a) Imagine a single PhD student (b) building their work on an erroneous finding. (b) In Switzerland, their cumulative salary alone will (c) run to six figures. (c) Flawed research that is translated into health care, policymaking or engineering can harm people. And there are opportunity costs — for every grant awarded to a project unknowingly building on errors, (d) another project is not pursued. (d) Like technology companies, stakeholders in science must realize that (e) making error detection and correction being part of (e) the scientific landscape is a sound investment.
