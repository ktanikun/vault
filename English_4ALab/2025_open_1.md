4 (A) 以下の英文の段落(21)~(25)にはそれぞれ文法上または内容上の誤りがある。修正が必要な下線部を各段落から一つずつ選び、マークシートの(21)~(25)にその記号をマークせよ。

(21) A decade ago (a) humanity sent around 200 objects into space (a) per year. Now we launch more than 2,600, (b) with no prospects for slowing down. (b) This rapid expansion of human activity in outer space (c) has filled Earth's orbit (c) with space trash, from dead satellites to used-up rocket parts. (d) The region is already too crowded that  (d) working satellites run the risk of colliding with bits of garbage from previous generations of spacecraft.  Since its launch in 1998, even the International Space Station has had to (e) adjust its orbit at least 39 times (e) to dodge space debris; yet, despite requiring precise calculations, these avoidance measures cannot eliminate all risks of potentially disastrous collisions.

(22) Currently there are more than 25,000 pieces of trackable human-made junk (a) larger than 10 centimeters (a) orbiting Earth. The more we put up there, (b) the greater the chance that (b) pieces of debris (traveling at relative speeds up to 15 times faster than a bullet) will strike working spacecraft, (c) creating even more dangerous trash. (c) The disastrous collision in 2009 (d) between the non-functioning Russian satellite Cosmos 2251 and (d) the functioning Iridium satellite, for example, generated nearly 2,000 debris fragments, (e) many of them are still (e) being tracked today.

(23) Orbital space is a finite resource, and (a) it's rapidly being consumed by (a) a few dominant organizations, notably SpaceX, OneWeb and Amazon's Project Kuiper. SpaceX, for instance, (b) owns and operates the majority of (b) all working satellites, and the company aims to send (c) tens of thousands more satellites than to provide (c) global broadband Internet coverage. Similarly, Amazon (d) plans to use 3,236 satellites (d) for its broadband network. (e) What these plans attempt to do is add (e) thousands more satellites to the already overcrowded region of space.

(24) If (a) we keep up this pace, (a) orbital space will become unusable — especially the most popular region, low Earth orbit (LEO), (b) which extends up to 2,000 kilometers above Earth's surface. (b) When looking at all orbital regions, we (c) lose services we rely on: (c) continuous communications, GPS mapping, the Internet, Earth monitoring, and more. Today nearly every satellite that is launched (d) is equivalent to a piece of single-use plastic, (d) in that its fate is to become waste. (e) Giving everyone limited access without global coordination and planning (e) means that eventually no one may be able to use orbital space.

(25) As (a) we continue to push the boundaries of space exploration and  (a) commercialization,  there is a growing movement to rethink our approach (b) to using the space environment (b) — to move to a strategy based on careful monitoring (c) and sound waste-management principles. (c) I believe we must leave behind our "linear space economy," where we use and abandon, and (d) to move toward (d) a "circular space economy" — a sustainable way to use space that emphasizes the reuse, recycling, (e) and efficient management of space resources. (e)
