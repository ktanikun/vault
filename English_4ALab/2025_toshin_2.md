(21) Why do fitness device makers [a] claim you need to take [a] 10,000 steps every day? Do you also really need to drink eight glasses of water daily? The scientific basis for [b] popular health claims is often thin. [b] A piece in the New York Times, for example, notes that the idea of 10,000 steps [c] is based more on marketing [c] — it was the name of an early pedometer — than science. [d] Data point to clear benefits from moderate exercise [d] — perhaps 7,000 steps or so [e] but not necessary more. [e]

(22) Often popular wisdom turns out to be [a] only sort of true. [a] The emphasis on [b] so many steps is one instance. [b] Glasses of water is another. If you [c] let yourself get too thirsty, [c] you [d] may be tempted to reach to sodas [d] or sugary coffee drinks, and that's not good. But a scientific review in 2002 found "no scientific studies" that support the eight-glass claim for healthy adults in a temperate climate. That doesn't mean it's wrong, but it does mean we probably [e] shouldn't worry if we drink only six. [e]

(23) It's worthwhile [a] to dig a bit into [a] often heard health maxims [b] before accepting them literally. [b] You can sometimes find [c] a nugget of truth that has become seriously exaggerated, [c] or you discover that a claim [d] stems from outdated and poorly applied evidence. [d] [e] The later is what happened with a famous and specious claim about female fertility. [e]

(24) [a] For decades women have heard distressing warnings about their "biological clocks." [a] [b] We have been repeatedly told that fertility drops dramatically after age 30, [b] [c] so people who want children either need to get moving [d] and freeze their eggs. [d] Embryo freezing is now a big business, [e] and discussions of it are commonplace among young professional women. [e] Pregnancy, and age-linked anxiety about it, also occurs among transgender and nonbinary people.

(25) But, as Jean M. Twenge reported in 2013 in the Atlantic, the claim is based on very sparse data, much of them of dubious quality or relevance. The notion stems largely from [a] a 2004 paper based on records from 1670 through 1830. [a] Many things have changed since then, including medical care and nutrition. In wealthier nations, [b] people are now healthier overall and likely to be more fertile for longer periods of their lives. [b] Systematic data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics demonstrate that from 1980 to 2002 fertility rates [c] for women aged 30 and older were going down. [c] It is also worth noting that when infertility treatments started to [d] become more common and more clinics began opening [d] in the 1980s and 1990s, [e] alarms over biological clocks were being sounded by this growing industry [e] with a self-interest in the matter.
