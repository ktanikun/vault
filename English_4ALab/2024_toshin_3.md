(21) We humans (a)  have long considered ourselves (a)  the most intelligent species, largely (b)  due to our exceptional cognitive capabilities (b)  and sophisticated use of language. It is these unique abilities (c)  that have enabled us to reach space,(c)  extend our lifespans, and unlock many mysteries of the world. Traditionally, intelligence (d) was perceived as a rather linear fashion(d) , with a strong focus on logical and mathematical abilities, (e)  like those of bright individuals like Albert Einstein, (e)  as the indicators of a high intellect.

  

(22) However, the landscape of intelligence is now understood (a)  to be far more varied and intricate.(a)  This enriched understanding acknowledges (b)  multiple intelligences besides the logical-mathematical type,(b)  such as emotional intelligence, which allows us to navigate social complexities, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, (c)  which dancers and surgeons exhibit,(c)  visual-spatial intelligence, which is vital for architects and artists, and musical intelligence, (d) which is seen in composers and musicians.(d)  Each type of intelligence enables individuals to solve (e)  problems irrelevant to their specific environments and practices.(e) 

  

(23) And beyond the different varieties of intelligence among humans, scientists are starting to understand (a)  the capacity for intelligence in other species. (a)  Rosalind Arden from the London School of Economics and Political Science studies intelligence in humans and canines. She is especially interested in (b)  whether enhanced cognitive abilities can predict better than health outcomes within a species. (b)   This shift is part of a larger movement in the scientific community (c)  that is adopting broader definitions of intelligence: (c)  the ability to learn, adapt, and solve species-specific problems that are crucial for survival, for example, or the ability to achieve goals in different ways. And (d) an interesting result of thinking about intelligence (d)  in these terms means (e)  we can attribute intelligence broadly across a group of individuals,(e)  rather than to a single individual alone.

  

(24) This perspective has given rise to the term collective intelligence, (a)  which was coined by some researchers(a)  to describe how groups of animals, such as bee colonies or ant swarms, demonstrate remarkable problem-solving abilities. Arden points out that these collective behaviors (b)  are not indicative of individual intelligence.(b)  Rather, they arise (c) from a complex interplay of interactions(c)  within the group. For example, (d)  meanwhile we would not expect a hive of bees to conceptualize(d)  a mission to the moon, their collaborative efforts are finely (e)  tuned to ensure their survival and success(e)  within their ecological niche.

  

(25) Neurological studies are shedding light on the intricacies of intelligence (a)  at both individual and collective levels.(a)  Pioneering research by scientists like Julia Sliwa from the Paris Brain Institute is steering away from the traditional focus on individual cognition and (b)  moving towards understanding the neural basis(b)  of group intelligence. With the help of brain imaging technologies like electroencephalography, which measures electrical activity in the brain, (c)  neuroscientists have discovered what human brains synchronize with one another(c)  when people cooperate on a task. This synchronization, observed in humans and other mammals, may be a fundamental mechanism of social intelligence. The extent (d)  to which such neural synchronization plays a role(d)   in the social intelligence of insects (e)  remains an open question for future research.(e)
