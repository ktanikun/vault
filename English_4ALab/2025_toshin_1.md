(d) Tradition has it that (d) the work was drawn by a young Michelangelo, though scholars are (e) not as sure. (e)

(22) Last year, the Sernesi family sold the villa.

"It's very interesting, and now it's surely necessary to carry out further investigations," said Cecilie Hollberg, the director of the Accademia Gallery in Florence.
