(21) For half a century, the Sernesi family lived [a] in a storied villa overlooking Florence [a] where the Renaissance artist Michelangelo was raised and [b] he later owned. [b] The property [c] came with [c] several buildings, an orchard and a drawing of a muscular male nude etched on the wall of a former kitchen. [d] Tradition has it that [d] the work was drawn by a young Michelangelo, though scholars are [e] not as sure. [e]

(22) Last year, the Sernesi family sold the villa. Now they want to sell the mural drawing, [a] which was detached from its original location in 1979 [b] so that it could undergo a much-needed restoration. [b] Art historians have identified the figure, [c] and having etched with charcoal or black chalk on plaster [c] and [d] measuring about 40 by 50 inches, [d] as a "triton," a god of the sea, or a "satyr," [e] part man part beast. [e]

(23) Over the decades, the drawing [a] has been loaned as [b] a Michelangelo work to exhibitions [b] in Japan, Canada, China and, most recently, the United States, [c] where it was included to the Metropolitan Museum's blockbuster 2017 show "Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman and Designer" [c]. [d] The catalog entry for that exhibition, [d] by Carmen C. Bambach, the Met's curator of drawings and prints, [e] describes it as "the only surviving manifestation of Michelangelo's skill as a draftsman in large scale." [e]

(24) News that the drawing [a] is going on the market [b] is likely to expand [c] what has until now been [d] a rather low-key, academic debate over the authorship of a work that has remained in private hands, and mostly [e] under the public eye, for the past five centuries. [e]

"It's very interesting, and now it's surely necessary to carry out further investigations," said Cecilie Hollberg, the director of the Accademia Gallery in Florence. She had already been to take a look at the drawing, at the request of the Sernesi family, she said.

(25) Years ago, [a] culture ministry officials have declared [b] the work of national importance, [c] meaning that it cannot leave Italy [d] except on loan. [e] In the case of a sale, the culture ministry has the right of first refusal to match the sale price and buy the piece for the Italian state. [e]
