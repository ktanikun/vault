(21) Our perception of time is (a) anything but constant. (a) Two new studies suggest our heartbeat can cause passing moments (b) to feel either slower and faster. (b) The experiments, led by separate research groups, have (c) uncovered corresponding findings. (c) Together, their work confirms that the heart's activity influences our perception of time (d) as it passes. (d) They show that we can't look at the experience of time (e) in isolation from the body. (e)

  

(22) In April 2023, a group of neuroscientists led by Irena Arslanova of Royal Holloway, University of London, (a) reported that time perception (a) changes (b) with each heartbeat. (b) In their experiment, 28 people (c) learned to distinguish the duration of (d) two visual or two auditory stimuli. (d) For example, the study participants looked at two shapes or heard two distinct tones. One item or sound from each pair (e) presented for 200 milliseconds, (e) and the other lasted for 400 milliseconds.

  

(23) Next, people saw a new cue — another tone or shape — and had to estimate (a) how the presentation felt shorter or longer, (a) using the previous pair for reference. But there was an added twist. These new sounds and shapes were (b) matched with a particular moment (b) in the rhythm of someone's heart rate: when the heart either contracted (the systole) or relaxed (the diastole) (c) during the heartbeat. (c) During systole, the volunteers (d) perceived time duration to be shorter than it actually was. (d) During diastole, (e) the exact opposite was true. (e)

  

(24) According to Arslanova and her colleagues, the phenomenon may be (a) explained by the fact that (a) pressure sensors in blood vessel walls send signals to the brain and affect (b) its capacity to process incoming information. (b) (c) This increase in sensory impressions could make time feel longer. (c) A similar finding was published in March 2023 by a group of researchers at Cornell University, who (d) focused on differences in time perception (d) between single heartbeats. When that span is longer, they discovered, time feels slower. (e) When there is more time between two beats, time seems to move faster. (e)

  

(25) Researchers from both groups caution that those experiences are influenced by many factors, (a) including our emotion and attention. (a) They also happen (b) at a totally different scale. (b) As Adam K. Anderson, one of the authors of the March study, explains, however, the new work illuminates how the heart influences the experience of time as it unfolds. He confirms that how the body and brain relate is (c) of growing interest in neuroscience. (c) "People are (d) comfortable with the idea that the brain can influence what the heart does," (d) he says.  But reversing that relationship is novel and really fascinating. "Your brain," he adds, "might be listening to patterns in your heart to shape something (e) similarly fundamental as the passage of time." (e)
