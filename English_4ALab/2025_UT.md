(21) A practical way of conceiving rules in general is (a) to account to them as the mechanisms (a) that create consensus among players.  They are (b) the framework that is used to agree on (b) what has happened within the game.  (c) This idea, put forward (c) by designers Vincent Baker and Emily Care Boss,  (d) emerged in online discussions about creating (d) role-playing games.  These discussions also recognized the incomplete nature of rules, because (e) it is impossible to create in advance rules to cover (e) all the situations that can emerge in play. 

(22) In some traditions of game research, (a) rules are not necessarily intended to be fully binding. (a) In the field of operational gaming, (b) which games are utilized for goal-oriented purposes (b) such as forecasting, testing, and training,  gaming is divided into two categories. In rigid-rule gaming, the rules are exactly specified, (c) possibly implemented as a computer program, (c) and not altered after gaming starts, and " (d) every possible combination of players' decisions is thus exactly defined." (d) In free-form gaming, the participants supply some of the rules, and (e) they can sometimes even invent more rules (e) while the game is ongoing.

(23) (a) Not all constraints relating to a game (a) need to be shared socially.  Sometimes players come up with their own additional rules to make playing (b) more demanded or interested. (b) They may come up with new goals in games that are open ended, or they may decide to make the game easier (c) and ignore some formal rules. (c) Rules, laws, and norms obviously also exist outside of games. In social life, rules have a dual nature. As sociologist Thomas Janoski writes, "Rules are basic to group life, but (d) so is the play of power, (d) the effort to use others to achieve ends even against opposition." Social and societal rules are created, enforced, and violated by people, and they are connected with strategies of domination. Simultaneously, (e) rules order social reality (e) in ways that are not about domination. Janoski argues:

(24) Rules (a) that guide people in their everyday behavior (a), that tell them how to till the fields or work their machines or mate or die, (b) do much more than establish and maintain (b) patterns of hierarchy. (c) They make available people (c) the wisdom of accumulated experience,  and they secure people (d) against the totally unexpected in social encounters. (d) They also make possible the implicit cooperation that supports social life. In the classical line of sociological thinking, (e) rules originate and persist in the effort to solve (e) these problems of collective life. 

(25) These "problems of collective life" (a) influence games, for example, through end-user license agreements (a) and informal time limits. Additionally, gameplay (b) is also constrained by material reality. (b) The insecure pile of sticks and the shaking human hands (c) trying to pick up them (c) are both (d) constraints that limit player action (d), establishing the affordances that (e) make it possible for the player to perform (e) meaningful game actions.
