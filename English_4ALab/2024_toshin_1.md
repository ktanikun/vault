4 (A) 以下の英文の段落(21)~(25)にはそれぞれ文法上または内容上の誤りがある。修正が必要な下線部を各段落から一つずつ選び、マークシートの(21)~(25)にその記号をマークせよ。

(21) Is there a precise definition of the word conscience? As with many words, such as vegetable and friend, we (a) know well enough what it means, (a) despite lacking a precise definition. Because the meaning of conscience (b) may vary in different ways (b) across cultures and subcultures, as well as across time, for present purposes I (c) favor adopting this working formulation: (c) conscience is an individual's judgment about what is morally right or wrong, typically, but not always, reflecting (d) some standard of a group which (d) the individual feels attached. The decision of conscience is not solely cognitive, moreover, (e) but has two interdependent elements: (e) feelings that urge us in a general direction, and judgment that shapes the urge into a specific action.

(22) For children, learning the word conscience is not like learning the word dog. Conveniently, for dogs (a) we can point visually obvious examples, (a) and a child can easily generalize from poodles to huskies and corgis. It is not even like (b) learning what inner feeling to call thirst. (b) Conscience is not only more abstract, but it has a social dimension: knowledge of community standards. Especially at first, a child (c) will have only basic knowledge of those. (c) Moreover, learning social customs is often (d) not explicit at all, but implicit, (d) since we commonly mimic a behavior (e) without really being aware of doing so. (e)

(23) As children grow up, they begin to appreciate (a) that social contexts can be rather subtle, (a) even when they have a decent grasp of community standards. Sometimes a kind lie about someone's (b) singing voice is better than the truth, (b) and sometimes a well-intentioned offer to stack a neighbor's woodpile (c) can be perceived as insulting as their fitness. (c) Some parents (d) allow cursing and some forbid it. (d) Social life is full of subtlety: (e) the things you can say or cannot say, (e) and the best way to say the thing you normally should not say.

(24) When does the word conscience typically enter into our conversation, (a) be it inner voice or outer? (a) By and large, it is when we are in a dilemma; for example, when the law requires one thing, yet conforming to the law (b) would violate other strongly held values, (b) such as truthfulness or fairness. As portrayed in Steven Spielberg's movie Schindler's List, Oskar Schindler (c) regularly broke the law by misleading (c) his Nazi pals about the roster of Jews who worked for him in his factories in German-occupied Poland. (d) To those who did figure out that (d) the workers were Jews,  Schindler offered bribes to buy their silence. Normally, of course, breaking the law — not to mention lying and bribing — is regarded as wrong, but sometimes (e) that is why our conscience considers necessary. (e)

(25) We may consult our conscience (a) when winning a game conflicts with fairness, (a) as when a baseball pitcher considers beaning a star player (b) with a fastball to put him out of the game. (b) Or when (c) one is tempted to sacrifice loyalty for honesty, (c) as a staff member might lie (d) to shield his boss from a charge of conspiracy. (d) In 1975, White House counsel John Ehrlichman lied out of longtime loyalty to President Richard Nixon, which he later (e) came to regret when convicted of (e) perjury.
