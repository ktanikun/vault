4 (A) 以下の英文の段落(21)~(25)にはそれぞれ文法上または内容上の誤りがある。修正が必要な下線部を各段落から一つずつ選び、マークシートの(21)~(25)にその記号をマークせよ。

(21) When you think about it, it is amazing that (a) something so much tiny as (a) a living cell is (b) capable of behaviour so complex. (b) Consider the single-cell creature, the amoeba. (c) It can sense its environment, (c) move around, obtain its food, (d) maintain its structure, (d) and multiply. How does a cell (e) know how to do all of this? (e)

(22) Biology textbooks will tell you that each eukaryotic cell, (a) which constitutes a range of (a) organisms from humans to amoeba,  contains a control centre (b) within a structure called (b) the nucleus.  Genes present in the nucleus hold the 'information' (c) necessary of the cell to function. (c) And the nucleus, in turn, resides in a jelly-like fluid called the cytoplasm. Cytoplasm contains the cellular organelles, the 'little organs' in the cell; and these organelles, (d) the narrative goes, (d) carry out specific tasks (e) based on instructions provided by the genes. (e)

(23) In short, the textbooks paint a picture of a cellular 'assembly line' (a) where genes issue instructions (a) for the manufacture of proteins (b) that do the work of the body from day to day. (b) This textbook description of the cell matches, (c) almost word for word, (c) a social institution.  The picture of the cytoplasm and its organelles (d) performing the work of (d) 'manufacturing', 'packaging' and 'shipping' molecules according to 'instructions' from the genes evokes the social hierarchy of executives (e) ordered the manual labour of (e) toiling masses.  The only problem is that the cell is not a 'factory'. It does not have a 'control centre'.

(24) A wealth of research in biology suggests that 'control' and 'information' are not restricted at the 'top' but (a) present throughout the cell. (a) The cellular organelles do not just form a linear 'assembly line' but (b) interact with each other (b) in complex ways. (c) Nor is the cell obsessed with the economically significant work of 'manufacturing' (c) that the metaphor of 'factory' (d) would have us to believe. (d) Instead, much of the work that the cell does (e) can be thought of as (e) maintaining itself and taking 'care' of other cells. 

(25) Why, then, do the standard textbooks (a) continue to portray the cell (a) as a hierarchy? Why do they invoke a centralised authority to explain how each cell functions? And why is the imagery so industrially loaded? Perhaps this view of the cell (b) sounds obvious and natural to us (b) because (c) it resonates with our stratified societies (c) and their centralised institutions.  But the trouble with using this kind of metaphor in science is that assumptions about how a cell ought to function (d) prevent us from understanding (d) how the cell really functions.  What is more, when science projects social hierarchies onto the cell, it also (e) discourages the notion that (e) social hierarchies are 'natural'.
