(21) Great Nicobar Island in the Northern Indian Ocean is (a) one of the most pristine places on Earth. (a) It is important for its biodiversity conservation. (b) The beach on the island's southern end feature (b) the largest nesting site in the region for endangered Leatherback sea turtles.  More than 2,500 species of the island's plants and animals (c) have been recorded. (c) Of these, 17 percent can only be found there. (d) Its waters, only partially explored by scientists, (d) contain pristine coral reefs with 273 types of stony coral and 256 fish species. The island is also (e) home to tribal groups (e) such as the Great Nicobarese, the Andamans, and the elusive Shompen. 

(22) The members of the Shompen tribe, (a) numbering between 200 and 400, (a) live deep in the interior forest of Great Nicobar. They shun outsiders, and only fragments of their language and culture (b) have been uncovered. (b) Steep hills, dense jungles, and malaria have defeated those who seek to visit their hidden settlements. (c) Still, these travelers' accounts, (c) including those from their Great Nicobarese neighbors, offer a partial view of how the Shompen live. They build huts on platforms, usually near streams. For food, they spear crocodiles, fish, and other animals. They tend groves and, in small patches, cultivate vegetables and gather fruit and other forest edibles. (d) On rare occasions,(d) a few Shompen men visit the Great Nicobarese coastal villages to trade cane and honey for tools, tobacco, cloth, and other goods.  They refuse to (e) allow outsiders not to follow them back (e) into the jungle,  thus protecting their isolation.

(23) What the Shompens don't know is that their lives will soon drastically change. The Indian government, (a) in which inherited Great Nicobar Island (a) from British colonizers in 1950, (b) plans to build a massive transshipment terminal (b) there. The $9 billion free-trade zone will include (c) a port capable of handling  (c) 16 million cargo containers a year,  a city for 350,000 settlers from mainland India, (d) a power plant, and an airport (d) that can handle up to 4,000 passengers an hour.  The project (e) will spread over 244 square kilometers (e) — nearly a fifth of Great Nicobar — and destroy nearly a million rainforest trees.

(24) The effects of this project will be catastrophic for the islanders and wildlife. (a) One destructive aspect (a) is the massive influx of foreigners.  The Shompen are (b) not immune to (b) the diseases that thrive in the outside world and could be devastated by epidemics. New settlers will introduce dogs and cats (c) that prey on vulnerable creatures (c) like sea turtles and nesting birds.  Reducing the forest will lower humidity and precipitation levels, causing water shortages. Toxic runoff from the power plant will poison the soil and rivers, (d) where the Shompen fish (d) and collect drinking water.  Displaced animals will be forced to move upstream. The Shompen (e) will pressed to compete for (e) resources,  sparking a conflict with other groups that have, so far, maintained a peaceful relationship.

(25) Preservation groups within India launched a campaign to save the island (a) from the transshipment terminal. (a) Indigenous leaders from Great Nicobar Island also expressed in a letter to the government that "We feel (b) helpless and abandoned (b) and are extremely anxious about our future."  The Indian government answered by promising to reforest an area of dry hills in western India (c) that has no relation to the island. (c) Their solution for the islanders is to erect a militarized fence (d) surrounded the project territory (d) to keep crime and poachers away from their settlements. Unfortunately, this fence will also prevent people like the Shompen from using the spaces (e) they have occupied for millennia. (e)
