(21) Language is never neutral. There is no language which unambiguously brings peace and well-being to humankind. The choice of [a] one particular language over another [a] might be considered more neutral [b] in a given context by certain speakers. [b] This one language, however, could be considered [c] a politically loaded and biased choice [c] in another context and by other speakers. [d] The English language has no exception to these social realities [d] although [e] its often unquestioned status as a global lingua franca [e] might make it seem to be such.

(22) English as a lingua franca [a] has often portrayed as a 'neutral' medium [a] between people who speak a different first language. In South Africa, [b] English is far from a generally 'neutral' medium [b] and I examine precisely [c] the non-neutral and ambiguous nature of the way South Africans speak, hear, write, perceive, and [d] interpret English ways of speaking in a lingua franca context. [d] In fact, my major argument is that ambiguity is [e] the least disputed, most defining, and yet insufficiently acknowledged feature [e] of English as a lingua franca in the South African context.

(23) Investigating ambivalence among English lingua franca users is an opportunity [a] to reassess how they view their linguistic and social belongings [a] as they [b] attempt to make sense of an ever-changing world. [b] For linguistic anthropologists [c] there is a benefit in observing these ambivalent positions [c] and ambiguous dimensions by paying more attention to [d] inconsistencies and seeming contradictory positions. [d] Several languages have acquired lingua franca functions throughout human history and lingua francas are utilized not only in international and cross-cultural contexts [e] but within national boundaries, such as South Africa. [e]

(24) There are many different English lingua franca contexts in the world, [a] but they are all marked by various levels of competencies in the language among speakers. [a] Language ideological frameworks position one variety, most commonly the 'Standard', as superior and dominant. The coexistence of such a Standard English alongside non-Standard and lingua franca forms [b] create complex power dynamics [b] which are often racialized. We would be ignoring reality if an analysis of English lingua franca contexts [c] were to exclude interactions where monolingual native speakers interact with bilinguals and poor English speakers. [c] My own conceptualization of lingua franca interaction [d] is, to some extent, a type of communication characterized by much sociolinguistic variation [d] which serves as the platform of interaction by a group of English speakers [e] with diverse levels of competencies. [e]

(25) My argument is [a] essentially, but not only, about power and ideology [a] because these concepts have [b] a fundamental impact to the politics of language. [b] The various contexts in which I analyse the ambiguity of the lingua franca status of English are [c] fundamentally based on a dialogue of unequal power relations. [c] Much of this unequal power and politics is due to the simple fact that African people [d] have been discriminated against throughout history. [d] My argument is thus not only linguistic but also about [e] racial identity politics in its multiple forms, with a focus on English lingua franca communication. [e]
