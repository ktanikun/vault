4 (A) 以下の英文の段落(21)~(25)にはそれぞれ誤りがある。修正が必要な下線部を各段落から一つずつ選び、マークシートの(21)~(25)にその記号をマークせよ。

(21) For millennia, humanity (a) <u>has occupied itself with the exploration of reality</u> and the quest for knowledge. The process has been based on the conviction that, with diligence and focus, (b) <u>applying human reason to problems can</u> yield measurable results. When mysteries arose, humanity was able to identify the right questions, collect the necessary data, and (c) <u>reason its way to an explanation.</u> Over time, knowledge acquired (d) <u>through this process created by</u> new possibilities for action, (e) <u>yielding new questions to which reason could be applied.</u>

(22) (a) <u>However imperfectly this process may have been,</u> it has transformed our world and fostered (b) <u>confidence in our ability, as reasoning beings,</u> to understand our condition and confront its challenges. Humanity has traditionally assigned (c) <u>what it does not comprehend to one of the following two categories:</u> either a challenge for the future application of reason (d) <u>or an aspect of the divine,</u> not (e) <u>subject to processes and explanations</u> that we can directly understand.

(23) The advent of AI obliges us to confront the question of whether there is a form of logic that (a) <u>humans have not achieved or cannot achieve,</u> exploring aspects of reality we have never known and may never directly know. When a computer that is training alone (b) <u>devises a chess strategy that has never been</u> occurred to any human in the game's millennial history, what has it discovered, and how has it discovered it? What essential aspect of the game, previously unknown to human minds, (c) <u>has it perceived?</u> When a human-designed software program, (d) <u>carrying out an objective assigned by its programmers,</u> learns and applies a model that no human recognizes or could understand, are we advancing toward knowledge? Or (ce) <u>is knowledge going away from us?</u> 

(24) Humanity has experienced technological change throughout history. Only rarely, however, (a) <u>technology has fundamentally transformed</u> the social and political structure of our societies. More frequently, the (b) <u>adapt</u> preexisting frameworks through which we order our social world and absorb new technology, evolving and innovating within recognizable categories. The car replaced the horse without forcing a total shift in social structure. The rifle replaced the musket, but the general paradigm of conventional military (c) <u>activity remained largely unaltered.</u> But (d) <u>AI promises to transform all realms of human experience.</u> And the core of its transformations (e) <u>will ultimately take place at the philosophical level,</u> transforming how humans understand reality and our role within it.

(25) The unprecedented nature of this process (a) <u>is both profound and perplexing;</u> having entered it gradually, we are undergoing it passively, largely unaware of what it has done and (b) <u>likely to do in the coming years.</u> Its foundation was laid by computers and the internet. Its high point will be AI that is ubiquitous, expanding human thought and action (c) <u>in ways that are both obvious and less consciously perceived.</u> Now that (d) <u>the promise of AI and machine learning has been demonstrated,</u> and the computing power needed to operate sophisticated AI (e) <u>is becoming readily available,</u> few fields will remain unaffected.
