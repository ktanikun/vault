4 (A) 以下の英文の段落 (21) ~ (25) にはそれぞれ誤りがある。修正が必要な下線部を各段落から一つずつ選び、マークシートの (21) ~ (25) にその記号をマークせよ。

(21) Language is never neutral. There is no language which unambiguously brings peace and well-being to humankind. The choice of (a) one particular language over another (a) might be considered more neutral (b) in a given context by certain speakers. (b) This one language, however, could be considered (c) a politically loaded and biased choice (c) in another context and by other speakers. (d) The English language has no exception (d) to these social realities  although (e) its often unquestioned status as a global lingua franca (e) might make it seem to 2be such.

(22) English as a lingua franca (a) has often portrayed as a 'neutral' medium (a) between people who speak a different first language. In South Africa, (b) English is far from a generally 'neutral' medium (b) and I examine precisely (c) the non-neutral and ambiguous nature of the way (c) South Africans speak, hear, write, perceive, and (d) interpret English ways of speaking (d) in a lingua franca context.  In fact, my major argument is that ambiguity is (e) the least disputed, most defining, and yet insufficiently acknowledged feature (e) of English as a lingua franca in the South African context.

(23) Investigating ambivalence among English lingua franca users is an opportunity (a) to reassess how they view (a) their linguistic and social belongings  as they (b) attempt to make sense of an ever-changing world. (b) For linguistic anthropologists (c) there is a benefit in observing (c) these ambivalent positions  and ambiguous dimensions by paying more attention to (d) inconsistencies and seeming contradictory positions. (d) Several languages have acquired lingua franca functions throughout human history and lingua francas are utilized not only in international and cross-cultural contexts (e) but within national boundaries, (e) such as South Africa. 

(24) There are many different English lingua franca contexts in the world, (a) but they are all marked by (a) various levels of competencies in the language among speakers. Language ideological frameworks position one variety, most commonly the 'Standard', as superior and dominant. The coexistence of such a Standard English alongside non-Standard and lingua franca forms (b) create complex power dynamics (b) which are often racialized. We would be ignoring reality if an analysis of English lingua franca contexts (c) were to exclude interactions  (c) where monolingual native speakers interact with bilinguals and poor English speakers.  My own conceptualization of lingua franca interaction (d) is, to some extent, a type of communication (d) characterized by much sociolinguistic variation (e) which serves as the platform of interaction (e) by a group of English speakers  with diverse levels of competencies. 

(25) My argument is (a) essentially, but not only, about power and ideology (a) because these concepts have (b) a fundamental impact to the politics of language. (b) The various contexts in which I analyse the ambiguity of the lingua franca status of English are (c) fundamentally based on a dialogue (c) of unequal power relations.  Much of this unequal power and politics is due to the simple fact that African people (d) have been discriminated against (d) throughout history. (d) My argument is thus not only linguistic but also about (e) racial identity politics in its multiple forms, (e) with a focus on English lingua franca communication.
