(21) You probably don't recognize his name, but Mike Lazaridis (a) has had a defined impact on your life. (a) From an early age, it was clear that (b) Mike was something of an electronics wizard. (b) By the time he turned four, he was building his own record player out of Lego and rubber bands. In high school, when his teachers' TVs were broken, (c) they called Mike to fix them. (c) In his spare time, he built a computer and designed a better buzzer for high school quiz-bowl teams, (d) which ended up paying for his first year of college. (d) Just months before finishing his electrical engineering degree, (e) Mike did  what so many great entrepreneurs of his era would do: (e) he dropped out of college. It was time for this son of immigrants to make his mark on the world.

(22) Mike's first success came when (a) he patented a device for reading the bar codes on movie film, (a) which was so useful in Hollywood that it won an Emmy and an Oscar for technical achievement. That was (b) small potatoes compared to his next big invention, (b) which (c) made his firm the fastest-growing company on the planet. (c) Mike's flagship device quickly attracted a cult following, (d) with loyal customers ranging from Bill Gates to Christina Aguilera. (d) "It's literally changed my life," Oprah Winfrey gushed. "I cannot live without this." After arriving at the White House, (e) President Obama refused to hand him over to the Secret Service. (e)

(23) Mike Lazaridis (a) dreamed up the idea for (a) the BlackBerry as (b) a wireless communication device for sending (b) and receiving emails.  (c) As the summer of 2009, it (d) accounted for nearly half of (d) the U.S. smartphone market. By 2014, its market share had plummeted (e) to less than 1 percent. (e)

(24) When a company takes a nosedive like that, (a) we can never pinpoint a single cause of its downfall, (a) so we tend to anthropomorphize it: BlackBerry failed to adapt. Yet (b) adapting a changing environment isn't something a company does (b) — it's something people do (c) in the multitude of decisions they make every day. (c) As the cofounder, president, and co-CEO, Mike was in charge of all the technical and product decisions on the BlackBerry. Although (d) his thinking may have been the spark that ignited the smartphone revolution, (d) (e) his struggles with rethinking ended up sucking the oxygen (e) out of his company and virtually extinguishing his invention. Where did he go wrong?

(25) Most of us take pride in our knowledge and expertise, and (a) in staying true to our beliefs (a) and opinions. That makes sense in a stable world, (b) where we get rewarded for having conviction in (b) our ideas. The problem is that (c) we live in a rapidly changing world, (c) where we need to (d) spend as much time rethinking as we are thinking. (d) Rethinking is a skill set, but it's also a mindset. We already have many of the mental tools we need. (e) We just have to remember to (e) get them out of the shed and remove the rust.
