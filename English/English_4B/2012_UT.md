Ish = Kazuo Ishiguro. (イ)はitを何か明らかにすること。

It’s perhaps not much known that Ish has a  musical side. I was only vaguely aware of it, if at all, when I interviewed him, though I’d known him by then for several years — (ア) <u> a good example of how he doesn’t give much away.  </u> Ish plays the piano and the guitar, both well. I’m not sure how many different guitars he now actually possesses, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s in double figures. His wife, Lorna, sings and plays; so does his daughter. Evenings of musical entertainment in the Ishiguro household can’t be at all uncommon.

One of the few regrets of my life is that I have no formal grounding in music. Ｉnever had a musical education or came from the sort of ‘musical home’ that would have made this possible or probable, and always rather readily assumed that music was what those other, ‘musical’ people did. (イ) <u> I’ve never felt, on the other hand, though a great many people who didn’t grow up reading books have perhaps felt it, that writing is what those other, ‘writerly’ people do. </u> 

This contrast between writing and  music is strange, however, since I increasingly feel that a lot of my instincts about writing are in fact musical, and I don’t think that writing and music are fundamentally so far apart. The basic elements of narrative — timing, pacing, flow, tension and release, repetition of themes — are musical ones too. And (ウ) <u> where would writing be without rhythm, </u> the large rhythms that shape a story, or the small ones that shape a paragraph?

これは彼があまり自身についてのことを話さないことを示す好例である。 (3/3)

一方で、かなり多くの本を読まずに育った人たちはもしかしたら文学は**文章は**文学的な人**作家気質な人**のものだと思うかもしれないが、私は一度も文学は**文章は**そういう人が書くものだと思ったことはなかった。 (4/6)
