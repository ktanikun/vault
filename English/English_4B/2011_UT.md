But there were innovations in the sphere of language as well. Although now scarcely remembered as an event of any cultural significance, the arrival of the crossword puzzle in 1924 may be seen as marking a new kind of relationship between the educated public and the vocabulary of the English language. It started as a newspaper trend, promoted by the offer of cash prizes, but it soon established itself as a national tradition, confirmed by the introduction of the first daily crossword in The Times, a British newspaper, in 1930. By this time, crossword fans were beginning to appear in fiction, too.
