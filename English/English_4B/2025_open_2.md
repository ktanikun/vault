(B) 以下の英文を読み、下線部(ア)、(イ)、(ウ)を和訳せよ。

It's fantastic that our society is finally talking about children's mental health and what we can do to improve it. But it's sad that children's mental health is at crisis point. The early stages of life are so important when it comes to fostering a sense of security in our children, but it is not too late to take steps to attempt to repair any damage that may have occurred during the early years if your child is older.

There are no guarantees that a deprived, terrible childhood will result in mental-health problems later, or that an ideal childhood will protect someone from losing their mind. (ア) <u> Having said that there are things we can do that will give our children the best possible chance to minimize any potential mental health problems. </u>  We owe it to them and to ourselves 'to pursue a course that has the greatest likelihood of resulting in a healthy mind and body.

One of the most important indicators for good mental health is a strong bond between parent and child. But how can you make that bond as rewarding as possible for both of you, and one that is most likely to create a capacity for health and happiness? (イ) <u> It is very important to keep a baby company as they experience their feelings and moods so they don't feel alone. Just as important is for a baby to be physically close to their parents. </u> But how, in addition to being physically close, do we get emotionally close to a baby or a young child? (ウ) <u> After all, it's not as though you can both use words. </u> What creates your bond and your relationship is give and take. By that, I am talking about the mutual influence we have on each other. It might seem obvious that I affect you, you affect me, and we form a unique relationship together, different from other relationships we have with other people. And this is what will probably unconsciously happen between you and your baby.
