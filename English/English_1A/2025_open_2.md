1 (A) 以下の先住民の言語 (Indigenous language) についての英文を読み、その内容を70~80字の日本語で要約せよ。句読点も字数に含める。

Language, it is often said, is a window into the human mind. Take, for example, Tuvan language the language spoken by the Tuvan people, herding nomads living in the middle of Siberia. Tuvans are deeply connected to the environment, constantly scanning the horizon and monitoring the weather and the sounds of their animals; they coexist with nature. That close relationship with nature is deeply reflected in their language, from its rich vocabulary for describing their livestock and the world around them to its very sound, which can closely mimic noises of the landscape.

Many Indigenous languages are nature-centric in this way, reflecting millennia of deep observation of the natural world. Scholars increasingly recognize that many of these tongues express much knowledge about the natural world that is unknown to Western science knowledge that linguist David Harrison argues may prove critical to protecting nature amid a global extinction crisis.

To protect biodiversity, first we have to know how much biodiversity exists and where it exists. Indigenous people are much closer than we are to knowing the richness of different species in their environments, how to use them for food or medicine and how they interact and behave. What they know about their natural environments far surpasses what Western scientists know and is uniquely expressed in their languages. Most of the world's plant species, for instance, have not yet been categorized within a Western scientific framework. But, as Harrison says, "You talk to local people, and they tend to know all the plants and animals in their environment." Acquiring this kind of knowledge through Indigenous languages can help us deepen our understanding about biodiversity.

The United Nations and other bodies have long acknowledged that Indigenous communities are usually better guardians of biodiversity than other people who are less attached to nature. "If we're willing to be humble enough to learn from Indigenous people," Harrison says, "what they know could help save the planet. Learning these nature-centric concepts in Indigenous languages makes you see the environment differently."
